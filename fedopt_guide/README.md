# FedOpt Guide experiments

## Overview

Implements and experiments with three tasks for "A Field Guide to Federated
Optimization" ([arXiv link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.06917)).

## Requirements

This code is implemented with
[TensorFlow Federated](https://www.tensorflow.org/federated). See
[Using TFF for Federated Learning Research](https://www.tensorflow.org/federated/tff_for_research)
for more instructions on using TensorFlow Federated for research.

The following packages may need to be installed

<!-- mdformat off (multiple lines of small code piece) -->

```bash
absl-py~=0.10
attrs~=19.3.0
numpy~=1.19.2
pandas~=0.24.2
tensorflow-federated-nightly
tf-nightly
```

<!-- mdformat on -->

## Example usage

The following command can be used to train 100 rounds for the Stack Overflow
Transformer task.

```
bazel run stackoverflow_transformer:federated_trainer -- --total_rounds=100
--client_optimizer=sgd --client_learning_rate=0.1 --client_batch_size=16
--server_optimizer=adam --server_learning_rate=0.03 --server_adam_epsilon=0.001
--clients_per_round=10 --client_epochs_per_round=1
--experiment_name=stackoverflow_experiment
```
