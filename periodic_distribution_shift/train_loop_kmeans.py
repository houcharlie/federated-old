  We assume that the iterative process has the following functional type

        the output type of `initialize`, and `metrics` has member that is a
        python mapping with string-valued keys.

  This method performs up to `total_rounds` updates to the `state` of `process`.
  At each `round_num`, this update occurs by applying `process.next` to
  `state` and the output of ``client_selection_fn(round_num)`. We refer to this
  as a single "training step".

  This method also records how long it takes (in seconds) to call
  `client_selection_fn` and `process.next` at each round and add this to the
  round metrics with key `tff.simulation.TRAIN_STEP_TIME_KEY`. We also record
  how many training steps would occur per hour, which has key
  `tff.simulation.TRAIN_STEPS_PER_HOUR_KEY`.

  In full generality, after each round, we compute validation metrics via
  `validation_fn` (if not `None`), add these to the metrics created by
  `process.next` (prefixing with `tff.simulation.VALIDATION_METRICS_KEY`), save
  the combined metrics using the `metrics_managers` (if not `None`), and save a
