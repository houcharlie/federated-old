        "\n",
        "In this work, we conform to the add/remove notion of DP (where neighboring data sets differ by addition/removal of a single client). In the absence of a client at any training step, we assume that the client's model update gets replaced with the all zeros vector. This assumption enforces a subtle modification to the traditional definition of the add/remove notion of DP which allows neighboring data sets to have the same number of records. The formal definition is provided in Definition 1.1 in [the paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.00039). It is a special instantiation of Definition II.3 (removal DP) in [Erlingsson et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.03618).\n",
        "\n",
        "Our privacy guarantee holds for all well-behaved clients (that is, clients that faithfully follow the algorithm including participation limits).  One thing to emphasize is that due to the design of the algorithm, a mis-behaved client does not adversely affect the DP guarantee of any well-behaved clients.\n",
        "\n",
        "The notion of adjacency is with respect to arbitrary training datasets on each client device (i.e., the device removed might have an aribtrarily large local dataset containing arbitrary training examples). For user's with a single device, this corresponds directly to user-level DP; for devices shared with multiple users, this provides a stronger notion of DP than user-level; for a user with say 2 devices that happen to both participate in training the model, the notion is weaker, but group privacy can be used to obtain a user-level guarantee.\n"

        "The main idea in the algorithm is the following:\n",
        "\n",
        "Let $T$ be the number of rounds (`total_steps` in the code below) of the server-side training process, and in each round $t \\in [T]$, we compute $\\nabla_t$, which is the sum of gradients over `COHORT_SIZE` distinct clients who contributed at round $t$, at the current model state $\\theta_t$. Now, we create a forest of binary trees as follows: \n",
        "\n",
        "   1. Create a complete binary tree with $T'$ leaf nodes, where $T'$ equals to smallest power of two $\\geq T$. \n",
        "   1. Set the first $T$ leaf nodes (from left) to be $\\nabla_1,\\ldots,\\nabla_T$ respectively, and delete the remaining leaf nodes. \n",
        "   1. Delete all the internal nodes $z$ which are not complete binary trees rooted at $z$ (that is, delete all $x$ where any leaf of the subtree rooted at $x$ is not present/has been deleted). \n",
        "   1. Set each node $z$ of this forest to be the sum of all the leaves in the subtree rooted at $z$. Call the resulting forest $\\cal T$.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this formulation, each client is allowed to participate *only once* in the computation of any $\\nabla_t$, and a maximum of $E$  times (`max_participation` in the code below). Furthermore, each client is allowed to participate *once in every 24-hours*. We encode this constraint in the privacy accounting via $\\xi$ (`min_separation` in the code below), which is the minimum number of rounds in between two successive participation of any clients. Recall, the following: \n",
        "\n",
        "  * Each node $z\\in\\cal T$ stores a sum of all the $\\nabla_t$'s in the leaves of the sub-tree rooted at $z$. \n",
        "  * Each leaf node in $\\cal T$ only affects values at the nodes in the path path from it to the root of $\\cal T$. \n",
        "\n",
        "Let $L$ be the clipping norm of each individual client gradient participating in any of the $\\nabla_t$'s. For `noise multiplier` $\\sigma$, the noise that gets added to each node in the tree $\\cal T$ is sampled from ${\\cal N}\\left(0, \\sigma^2 L^2\\right)^{p}$, where $p$ is the dimensionality of the model update. Let $\\zeta^*$ bound the squared $\\ell_2$-sensitivity of the tree $\\cal T$: Consider an empty forest with the same structure of $\\cal T$, call it $\\widehat{\\cal T}$. Let $c\\in\\{0,1\\}^T$ be any bit vector with $\\|c\\|_0\\leq E$ (with $E$ being the maximum number of participations per client), and any two successive ones have at least $\\xi$ zeros in between them. Let $\\widehat{\\cal T}(c)$ be an instantiation of $\\widehat{\\cal T}$ with the leaf nodes being $c$, and each internal node being the sum of all the leaves in the sub-tree rooted at that node. We define $\\zeta^*=\\max\\limits_c\\sum_{z\\in\\widehat{\\cal T}(c)}z^2$. In Theorem D.3 [in the paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.00039) (and in function `_tree_sensitivity_square_sum`), we provide a dynamic programming based approach to calculate an upper bound on $\\zeta^*$. \n",
        "\n",
        "Since our algorithm is primarily based on the Gaussian mechanism, we can easily provide $\\rho$-zCDP guarantee, along with $(\\epsilon,\\delta)$-DP guarantee (with $\\delta$ being `target_delta` in the code below). The bound for zCDP is immediate, and taken care of by function `compute_zcdp`. It is a direct consequence of Lemma 2.4 of [Bun and Steinke'16](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.02065.pdf) and Theorem D.3 [in our paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.00039)."

This is achieved via post-processing of the tree aggregation method: we estimate the sum of updates on round $t$ by taking the difference between the private estimates of the cumulative sums after round $t$ and $t-1$. Finally, for optimization we want an average update, which is provided (again via post-processing) by a [` tfp.NormalizedQuery`](https://www.tensorflow.org/responsible_ai/privacy/api_docs/python/tf_privacy/NormalizedQuery) parameterized by `COHORT_SIZE`. The privacy calculations are independent of the constant `COHORT_SIZE`, but utility depends on (roughly) `COHORT_SIZE` clients contributing to each round.\n",
