  We assume that the iterative process has the following functional type
  signatures:

    *   `initialize`: `( -> state)`.
    *   `next`: `<state, client_data> -> <state, metrics>` where state matches
        the output type of `initialize`, and `metrics` has member that is a
        python mapping with string-valued keys.

  This method performs up to `total_rounds` updates to the `state` of `process`.
  At each `round_num`, this update occurs by applying `process.next` to
  `state` and the output of ``client_selection_fn(round_num)`. We refer to this
  as a single "training step".

  This method also records how long it takes (in seconds) to call
  `client_selection_fn` and `process.next` at each round and add this to the
  round metrics with key `tff.simulation.ROUND_TIME_KEY`.

  This method uses up to two callbacks. The first, `on_loop_start`, accepts the
  initial state of `process`, and returns a starting `state` and `round_num` for
  the training loop. The callback can be used for things such as loading program
  states.

  The second callback, `on_round_end` is called after each training step. It
  accepts the output state and metrics of `process.next`, and the current round
  number, and returns a new state and metrics mapping. This can be used for
  computing and saving additional metrics.

  WARNING: These callbacks can access and mutate state and are intended for more
  advanced simulations where the state can be mutated outside of calling
  `process.next`. For example, the `on_round_end` callback can be used to
  mutate state according to the training metrics, enabling various kinds of
  adaptive simulations. If your simulation does not require such mutation, we
  recommend `tff.simulation.run_training_process` instead.

  Args:
    process: A `tff.templates.IterativeProcess` instance to run. Must meet the
      type signature requirements documented above.

      returning a list of client data to use as federated data for that round.
    total_rounds: The number of federated training rounds to perform.
    on_loop_start: An optional callable accepting the initial `state` of the
      iterative process, and returning a (potentially updated) `state` and an
      integer `round_num` used to determine where to resume the simulation loop.
    on_round_end: An optional callable accepting the `state` of the iterative
      process, an integer round number, and a mapping of metrics. The callable
      returns a (potentially updated) `state` of the same type, and a
